*Description*: 

By editing the `ssh` config file, `~/.ssh/config`, I was able to assign `ieng6` as an alias for my full remote account name, `cs15lsp22abo@ieng6.ucsd`. This then allows me to save time and effort by logging in to the remote server using just `ssh ieng6`. Furthermore, I am able to use the alias anywhere else I would be using the full account name: such as to transfer files with `scp`.
